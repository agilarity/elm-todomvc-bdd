# 7. Document behavioral requirements

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We need a clear definition of done from the point of view of the user (human or system).

## Decision

We will document requirements as a tree of goals and rules using [BDD](https://dannorth.net/introducing-bdd/) language. Goals will define each user action. Rules will explain what should be true after the action is taken.

## Consequences

These action-oriented requirements will make it possible to predict every expected result of value in the context of specific user goals.
