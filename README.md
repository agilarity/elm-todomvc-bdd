[Elm](https://elm-lang.org/) - _"A delightful language for reliable web applications."_

This project demonstrates a behavior driven implementation of the [TodoMVC](http://todomvc.com/) specification using the Elm language.

## Elm Resources

- [Elm Docs](https://guide.elm-lang.org/)
- [Elm Slack](https://elmlang.slack.com)
- [Elm Discourse](https://discourse.elm-lang.org/)
- [Elm Radio](https://elm-radio.com/)

## Implementation

- [Behavioral requirements](doc/requirements/solution-overview.md) were written to define a functional finish line.
- All requirements were implemented in a [test driven](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development) manner.
- The Requirements Coverage Report provides an objective assessment of progress. Execute `./run.sh coverage` to see the report.
- Project decisions are documented in [doc/decisions](doc/decisions).

### Deviation from TodoMVC

- The TodoMVC style was modified to make the `strong` element more visible.

## Build Instructions

To install Elm tools:

- Execute `./run tools`

To see production ver to start a development version in the Browser.sion in the Browser:

- Execute `./run prod`
- Open the `site/index.html`

To start a live development server.

- Execute `./run live`
